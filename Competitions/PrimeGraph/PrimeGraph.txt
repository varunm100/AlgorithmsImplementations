Problem description.
You are given a tree. If we select 2 distinct nodes uniformly at random, what's the probability that the distance between these 2 nodes is a prime number?

Input
The first line contains a number N: the number of nodes in this tree.
The following N-1 lines contain pairs a[i] and b[i], which means there is an edge with length 1 between a[i] and b[i].

Output
Output a real number denote the probability we want.
You'll get accept if the difference between your answer and standard answer is no more than 10^-6.

Constraints
2 ≤ N ≤ 50,000

The input must be a tree.

Example
Input:
5
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5

Output:
0.5
Explanation
We have C(5, 2) = 10 choices, and these 5 of them have a prime distance:

1-3, 2-4, 3-5: 2

1-4, 2-5: 3

Note that 1 is not a prime number.
